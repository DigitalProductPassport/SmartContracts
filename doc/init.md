# Digital Product Passport Smart Contracts

## Introduction

Welcome to the Digital Product Passport Smart Contracts repository! This project aims to implement smart contracts for managing ownership and data related to digital product passports on the Ethereum blockchain.

## What is a Digital Product Passport?

A digital product passport consolidates data from material sourcing and extraction through to end-of-life recycling. It is permanently affixed to each product in the form of an NFC chip, QR code, or RFID tag, and is continuously updated.

## Smart Contracts

### Ownership Contract

The Ownership contract manages ownership of digital product passports, allowing the owner to add and remove contributors who can perform specific actions.

### ProductPassport Contract

The ProductPassport contract stores details and data related to digital product passports, allowing setting and retrieving product details.

## Test Cases

The `test` directory contains test cases written in Solidity to ensure the correctness and functionality of the contracts.
